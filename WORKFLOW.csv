2,P0,docs,done,Define milestone workflow list,Need a single source of truth for what to fix next,WORKFLOW.csv tracked and referenced in README,"docs: add WORKFLOW.csv roadmap"
3,P0,panel,in_progress,Panel UI redesign (spacing/typography/buttons),Current UI feels cluttered and unattractive; buttons stick and tables overflow,All pages have consistent spacing; buttons compact; tables never overflow; key info is readable,"ui(panel): refresh layout + component styling"
4,P0,panel,todo,Refactor large page into components,app/page.tsx is too large and hard to iterate safely,Extract reusable components (Modals/Tables/Toolbar) without behavior regression,"refactor(panel): split page into components"
5,P0,panel,done,Polish Games UX: persist per-instance config,Settings (jar/mem/port/frp) are not persisted per server; restart loses intent,Daemon stores config under servers/<id>/elegantmc.json (or similar) and Panel reads/writes it,"feat(games): persist instance config"
6,P0,daemon,todo,Fix daemon build determinism (go.sum/modules),Docker build/host build may fail due to missing go.sum or module drift,daemon/go.sum committed and docker build succeeds consistently,"fix(daemon): add go.sum + tidy modules"
7,P0,daemon,done,Make Java selection configurable per instance,Users need automatic Java selection but also manual override per server,Panel settings supports optional java_path; daemon respects saved java_path when starting,"feat(daemon): per-instance java override"
8,P1,panel,done,Improve Nodes page: copy token + claim wording,Node management needs smoother UX and clearer ownership semantics,Token column has copy; add-node explains 'delete to rotate'; no overflow,"ui(nodes): improve table actions + copy"
